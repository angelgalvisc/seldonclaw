# PublicMachina Architecture

This document holds the technical detail that no longer belongs in the landing-page README.

## Runtime model

PublicMachina is a CLI-first TypeScript runtime with:

- one Node.js process for the operator or pipeline command
- one SQLite database per run or experiment
- one optional LLM provider configuration
- one optional SearXNG endpoint for web-grounded search
- one optional operator workspace for memory, session history, and simulation records

The product surface is not a sandboxed code runner and not a multi-process agent swarm. It is a typed simulation engine with a conversational operator on top.

## Web-grounded search

PublicMachina lets Tier A and Tier B actors search the real internet during simulation rounds through SearXNG.

### Search flow

```text
Round N
  ↓
Actor activates
  ↓
Build search query from topics, events, and feed context
  ↓
Check SQLite cache
  ↓
Query SearXNG on cache miss
  ↓
Apply exact cutoff date after retrieval
  ↓
Inject recent web information into the cognition prompt
  ↓
Actor decides what to do
```

### Why cutoff happens after retrieval

SearXNG exposes broad time filtering where engines support it, but PublicMachina applies the exact cutoff itself so a run can be replayed under the same information boundary even when result sources differ in date quality.

### Search configuration

```yaml
search:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: "http://localhost:8888"
  cutoffDate: "2024-09-15"
  strictCutoff: true
  enabledTiers: ["A", "B"]
  maxActorsPerRound: 4
  maxActorsByTier:
    A: 2
    B: 2
  allowArchetypes: ["media", "institution"]
  denyArchetypes: []
  allowProfessions: ["journalist", "analyst"]
  denyProfessions: []
  allowActors: []
  denyActors: []
  maxResultsPerQuery: 5
  maxQueriesPerActor: 2
  categories: "news"
  defaultLanguage: "auto"
  timeoutMs: 3000
```

### Replay model

Search results are cached in SQLite by query, cutoff, language, and category. That gives you:

- deterministic replay when seed and cache match
- auditability through `search_requests`
- offline reruns once results have already been cached

## Cognition tiers

PublicMachina uses tiered cognition to keep cost proportional to agent importance.

| Tier | Strategy | Typical use | Web search |
|---|---|---|---|
| `A` | Always LLM | key influencers, journalists, officials | Yes |
| `B` | Probabilistic LLM | active regular accounts | Yes |
| `C` | Rules only | background population | No |

Tier routing is deterministic under the run seed. Tier B calls the model stochastically; Tier C stays entirely rule-based.

## Time acceleration

Time acceleration is conservative. PublicMachina only fast-forwards spans where the engine can prove that no meaningful action is happening.

Conditions:

- no recent posts remain in the propagation window
- no scheduled or active events fire in the skipped span
- no actors activate during the skipped span

Configuration:

```yaml
simulation:
  totalHours: 72
  minutesPerRound: 60
  timeAccelerationMode: "fast-forward"
  maxFastForwardRounds: 24
```

Skipped spans are written to SQLite so the optimization remains inspectable.

## Platform policy

The engine does not assume a single hardcoded platform. Platform policy controls:

- platform name shown to cognition
- global action surface
- tier-specific allowed actions
- recommendation policy
- moderation response to reports

```yaml
platform:
  name: "x"
  features:
    upvoteDownvote: false
    threads: false
    characterLimit: 280
    anonymousPosting: false
    communitiesUserCreated: false
  actions:
    - post
    - comment
    - repost
    - quote
    - like
    - unlike
    - follow
    - unfollow
    - mute
    - block
    - report
    - delete
    - search
    - idle
  recsys: "hybrid"
  tierAllowedActions:
    A: ["post", "comment", "repost", "quote", "like", "unlike", "follow", "unfollow", "mute", "block", "report", "delete", "search", "idle"]
    B: ["post", "comment", "repost", "quote", "like", "unlike", "follow", "unfollow", "mute", "report", "delete", "search", "idle"]
    C: ["post", "comment", "repost", "like", "follow", "unfollow", "idle"]
  moderation:
    enabled: true
    reportThreshold: 3
    shadowBanOnThreshold: true
```

## Operator architecture

The conversational operator is layered on top of typed internals.

```text
User input
  ↓
assistant-operator.ts
  ↓
/help, /clear, /model, /stop, /exit  → deterministic slash commands
  ↓
assistant-planner.ts                 → choose reply vs tool call
  ↓
assistant-tools.ts                   → typed tools
  ↓
simulation-service.ts                → thin orchestration
  ↓
engine.ts                            → simulation loop
```

The operator also maintains:

- `IDENTITY.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `USER.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- daily notes
- session transcripts
- simulation history

Those memories live in the assistant workspace and stay separate from actor memory stored in SQLite.

## Data model

The simulation database centers on:

- `documents`, `chunks`, `claims`
- `entities`, `edges`
- `actors`, `beliefs`, `topics`, `memories`
- `posts`, `exposures`, `rounds`, `runs`
- `search_cache`, `search_requests`
- telemetry, embeddings, moderation, and narrative state

The full schema references already live in:

- [data-model.md](./data-model.md)
- [data-model.json](./data-model.json)

## CKP bundles

PublicMachina uses CKP as a portable actor exchange format, not as its runtime model.

Export bundles include:

- `claw.yaml`
- `actor_state.json`
- `beliefs.json`
- `topics.json`
- `memories.json`
- `posts.json`
- `exposures.json`
- `decisions.json`
- `provenance.json`
- `persona.md`
- `manifest.meta.json`

What this preserves:

- beliefs and topics
- lived memory
- authored posts
- exposure history
- decision traces

What it does not preserve yet:

- follow / mute / block graph state
- full round snapshots and RNG replay state
- full community state outside the exported actor
